                Hello! I'm Brian, and I am a full-stack software developer. Why
                full stack? Because I enjoy frontend development just as much as
                backend development! I love solving problems, and each solution
                is like adding a Lego piece to the final product.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2 xs:text-sm md: text-base">
                I started my career as a project/program manager in various
                industries, including e-discovery, e-commerce, and tech
                companies such as LinkedIn. During my time as a PM, I acquired
                many skills that are transferable to the world of coding. With
                my experience on the business side, I understand how crucial
                turnaround time is, how to have meaningful and efficient
                conversations about jobs to be done, and how to communicate
                effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2 xs:text-sm md: text-base">
                After my years in program management, I realized that I truly
                have a passion for creativity and problem-solving. I enjoy being
                challenged, testing my limits, and constantly learning. I love
                experimenting, discovering what works and what doesnâ€™t, learning
                from my peers, and witnessing how their creativity shines.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-2 xs:text-sm md: text-base">
                This realization led me to invest in myself by enrolling in
                General Assembly's three-month immersive software engineering
                bootcamp. I successfully graduated and am now looking to start
                my journey as a software developer.
